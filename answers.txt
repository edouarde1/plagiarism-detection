    �Computer science is the study of computing and its use in 
    applications through the method of maths, logic, and programming 
    languages. As you know, computers has a lot of use in daily life, 
    like how does our laptop work and how does the laptop process any 
    request you make . . .�

    �Computer science is the throughout study of computing, of 
    the basic structure and nature of computer, as well as its 
    use in applications through the method of mathematics, logic,

    b.txt
    �Computer science is the study of computers, what they are made of, 
    how they think, and how we can use them to make our lives easier. 
    The physical part of the computer is called the hardware. Computer 
    scientists that are interested in hardware can either develop parts 
    that make computers faster, or combine parts for other people. The 
    part of the computer that knows what to do is called the software 
    which is what is used to make programs. Computer scientists that 
    are interested in software can create programs that solve problems 
    and make our lives easier. Others work on computer theory like machine 
    learning and algorithms.�

    f.txt 
    Computer science is the study of computers, how they work, why they 
    work the way that they do, and how to make them do new things. Some 
    computer scientists may work on hardware which is what computers are 
    made of, others might work on software which is what is used to make 
    programs. These programs solve problems and make our lives easier. 
    Others still will work on computer theory including algorithms, computation, 
    and information. Overall, computer science is just as varied and broad 
    as any other science, but instead of working with the body like in biology, 
    we work with an electronic body called the computer.

Pair 6: (p.txt,f.txt)
Verbatim plagiarism detected between these documents. 

    p.txt
    Computer Science is the study of computers, how they work, why they work the way 
    they do, and how to create new programs on computers. People who study computer 
    science often create programs that allow people to do new things on computers. Things 
    that might be created on a computer would be something like a new game, or something 
    to help solve math problems, or something to let people all around the world chat with 
    each other. Almost anything new that is created on the computer is created under the 
    umbrella of computer science.

Question 2

One text pair that may require further investigation is (p.txt, z.txt). The containment values follow a 
similar pattern as the others in which as the n-gram gets larger the containment value decreases. Although 
the containment value decreases much faster as the n-grams increase. Which reduces the likelihood of 
verbatim plagiarism. Since there is some similarity in larger n-grams there may be some verbatim or inadequate 
plagiarism which might require further investigation.  

This similar observation is seen with (z.txt, f.txt) there is a possible chance of minimal plagiarism. 
Would require a human to determine this.

Question 3

If the texts are the same, as n increases the containment values will stay the same, 1. This because all sets of
 n-grams will match 100% of the time. They will always produce the same n-gram vectors.  

Question 4

Adding stemming onto the preprocessing procedure will change the outcomes of the containment values. This is because 
additional matches will be detected between words in different tenses and having different grammatical usages 
(e.g plural words vs non-plural words). This change will cause the containment values to increase.   

Question 5

To detect plagiarism for a small text a good value of n would be n=5. This value will not hold for borderline cases. 
There is a possibility of two text documents to only have a few matches between this value of n. Depending on the context, 
these documents could pass and not be considered plagiarism. In the result sets, the borderline pairs have a 5-gram 
containment value of about 8.

Considering that, in general this value is a good in detecting plagiarism between documents. If the containment value 
of n is high, there is a likely change that plagiarism is detected. In the plagiarized documents detected above, 
this value was generally above 10%. 



Question 6

For auto-detecting plagiarism a good value of n would be 10%. In the plagiarized cases listed in question 1, the 5-n gram 
containment values are above 10%. The borderline cases had 5-n gram values below 10%. That would mean that if the containment 
value is near or below 10%, this document might need to be investigated further and would not be auto-detected as plagiarized.
